#+title: Nix Server
#+author: Luis Victoria

* Important!
+ For this to work, this configuration depends on the existence of the =/etc/nixos/vars= and =/etc/nixos/tokens= directories.
  + Their existence makes these single =configuration.nix= files more general purpose.

** Creating variables
Unfortunately, using ~vim~ or ~echo~ to create variables will append a newline character at the end of the file and cause issues.

For example, if you want to create a =/etc/nixos/vars/timezone= file, then you should perform the following command:

#+begin_src bash
sudo sh -c 'printf "America/New_York" > /etc/nixos/vars/timezone'
#+end_src

* Setting Up
** Allowing SSH connections
+ Objective: Make server SSH-able through my own domain (lambda.lv)
  + Ultimate goal is to run the following command: ~ssh lv@lambda.lv~
1. Enable OpenSSH in =/etc/nixos/configuration.nix=:
   #+begin_src nix
services.openssh = {
  enable = true;
  settings.PermitRootLogin = "no";
}
   #+end_src
2. Port forward the server with internal & external ports 22 [[https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml][as per IANA]]. Make sure to use TCP protocol.
3. Find out your IP address. The way I did it was through
   #+begin_src bash
curl ifconfig.me
   #+end_src
4. Add a /AAAA/ record in my DNS settings for my *lambda.lv* domain.

* Troubleshooting
** Fan on slot 4 does not stop spinning!
*** Problem
+ Upon receiving power, fan on slot 4 turns on at full speed
+ Server does not need to be 'on', just needs to have electricity
+ Issue is not physical fan
  + *Proof*: Despite switching the slots of the fans, the fan on slot 4 continues to be the one spinning

*** Solution
**** Sources
+ As [[https://www.dell.com/community/en/conversations/rack-servers/r720-fan-4-still-running-after-shutdown/647f9136f4ccf8a8de2ac071?commentId=647f97b7f4ccf8a8deac25b1][per this thread on Dell Community forum]], this is a firmware issue and not a physical hardware issue.
  + Solution is to downgrade firmware to 2.41.40
  + Other sources backing this

+ Apparently, fan 4's role is [[https://www.dell.com/community/en/conversations/rack-servers/r720-fan-4-still-running-after-shutdown/647f9136f4ccf8a8de2ac071?commentId=647f9170f4ccf8a8de2f9f1a][to cool the iDRAC]]

***** My version
+ Upon writing experiencing this issue, my firmware is at
  + BIOS: 2.9.0
  + iDRAC Settings Version: 1.65.65.04
  + iDRAC Firmware Version: 2.65.65 (Build 15)

**** Performing solution
+ Install RHEL 7.9 from [[https://developers.redhat.com/products/rhel/download?source=sso][this page]]
  + Search and download [[IDRAC with Lifecycle Controller V.,2.41.40.40][iDRAC with Lifecycle Controller v2.41.40]] for RHEL7
  + Install firmware using ~chmod +x iDRAC-firmwarefile.bin~ then ~./iDRAC-firmwarefile.bin~
